# üëæ Recreating artwork in the browser
During the Visual Interface Design minor we followed a web animation course. The assignment for this course was to choose an artwork and recreate that artwork for the web. Using CSS animations and much more to make a none interactive piece of artwork to an interactive one. follows. Making sure that you present the artwork in the way that it supposed to look while adding your own touch to the design. To make the most of the two worlds, I started by doing research about the artwork and what the designers intention was of the artwork. Unfortunately, there was not much to find about this particular work. that's why I mainly studied the work of the chosen designer, his style and some biography. Added to that I researched the artwork content, why it was made, and for what. 

##  ‚òÅÔ∏è The artwork - Background information

This work (poster) was made by Pierre Mendell in 1998, presenting the "The twelfth night" by Shakespeare for the Bayerische Staatsoper. Pierre Mendell is an American-German designer, and one of the world's leading graphic designers. For almost 30 years he played a role in creating the visual identity of the neue sammlung ‚Äì the international design museum munich. 

Simplicity in forms is one of the many characteristics that Mendell's work had. Clean style, basic, essential, minimal, and prefers rational and smart solutions. Mendell himself says, that the reason that he prefers to avoid the use of photography is that it represents the reality that can change, while fixing a concept make it persists along time.

Another characteristic is complexity in ideas. Despite his work being connoted by immediacy and simplicity, you can find a lot of the complexity in his themes and concepts.

Mendell's work also presents very strong and immediate colors. Usually, you can find three, or almost four colors per poster. Color can be full of simulates texture or brush. 

The directness of Mendell's work can achieve the goal of transcending every cultural or idiomatic bond. 
" The key to a powerful communication begins with the use of symbols that transcend reality and can be comprised by everyone".

### Twelfth Night - By William Shakespeare
- A love triangle
Twelfth Night, or What You Will is a romantic comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written around 1601‚Äì1602 as a Twelfth Night's entertainment for the close of the Christmas season. The play centres on the twins Viola (Viola is one of Shakespeare's cross-dressing heroines) and Sebastian, who are separated in a shipwreck. Viola (who is disguised as Cesario) falls in love with Duke Orsino, who in turn is in love with Countess Olivia. Upon meeting Viola, Countess Olivia falls in love with her thinking she is a man.

### Thoughts on the artwork
I think that Mendell wanted to represent the two twins by the two clouds. They are the same but also the opposite of each other. But he can also be representing the lovers that are looking at the opposite side of each other. And have no idea of the love that is in each heart.

- from still to movement and interactivity


### üéØ Concept - Desgin decisions
This poster by Mendell is one of the poster series that he designed for the (Opera name). It follows the simple yet expressive design of Mendell. Using simple, textured elements, solid background color, and some simple white typography for the poster's information. Medell design had texture, that is why I decided to play with the texture of the clouds. A 3D effect to give the poster a realistic, fun touch. Where the user can use the mousepad to zoom in to the clouds and zoom out of them. Also, the clouds follow the movement of the user's mouse that gives more interactivity to those simple elements. 

Clouds that have eyes are not that crazy so let's make them crazier by animating them. That gives the poster a much bigger touch of nonsense and attacks the user's attention to the main elements in the poster (the clouds). 

Another decision was to add background music. Twelfth Night is a play by William Shakespeare that has some amazing musicals. That is why I decided to add overtures by composer Sir Alexander Campbell Mackenzie, in1888. 

A clear blue sky with two clouds represents the daytime in the original poster. That is why I decided to have a contrasting night themed poster to represent the nighttime in Shakespeare's play. The user can switch between the different themes. The night poster will have another background music by the same composer. The different music will help the user to switch between a funny bright theme to the romantic night theme.

Mendell's work was full of simple symbols that everyone can understand. That is why I decided to add extra interactive elements to the poster. Like the rainbow between the clouds that represents connection and love that is clearly represented in the play, the animated red hearts rain as a simple symbol of love, and the animated stars that adds more to the night theme.

### ü§ñ Animations
**Animated clouds**

**Animated eyes**

**Animated rainbow**

To create the rainbow shape I used a ```<div>``` element as a container that has within multiple ```<div>``` elements te represent the different colors of the rainbow.

Each ```<div>``` element is a circle that has a different border color. Each circle also has a ```clip: react()``` to show only the half of the circle and give it an arc shape.
```css
.arc {
    animation: spin ease-in-out 2s normal both;
    border-radius: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
}
.arc-red {
    border: 40px solid #e31d28;
    clip: rect(0 490px 245px 0);
    height: 490px;
    margin-left: -245px;
    margin-top: -245px;
    width: 490px;
    animation-delay: 1.8s;
    opacity: 0;
}
```

The ```<div>``` parent element has also a ```clip: react()``` to show only the top half of the rainbow. This will give the effect that the rainbow is moving from one side to the other during the animation. 
```css
.rainbow {
    clip: rect(0 490px 245px 0);
    height: 490px;
    left: -30%;
    position: absolute;
    top: -10%;
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-25%);
    width: 490px;
    transform: rotate(-90deg);
}
```

The animation moves the arcs and makes them rotate ```transform: rotateZ();```. And each arc has a different delay ```animation-delay: ();```


**Animated hearts**

Using ```:before``` and ```:after``` pseudo-classes on a ```<div>``` element to create a heart shape.
```css
  .hearts {
    background-color: red;
    display: inline-block;
    height: 25px;
    margin: 0 10px;
    position: relative;
    top: 0;
    transform: rotate(-45deg);
    width: 25px;
    opacity: 0;
  }
  
.hearts:before,
.hearts:after {
    content: "";
    background-color: red;
    border-radius: 50%;
    height: 25px;
    position: absolute;
    width: 25px;
  }
  
.hearts:before {
    top: -15px;
    left: 0;
  }
  
.hearts:after {
    left: 15px;
    top: 0;
  }
  
```

By creating multiple ```<div>``` elements and giving them a position. I was able to animate them and create a heart rain effect using Keyframes animation in css.
```css
/* hearts animation */
@keyframes heartOne {
    0% {
        top: 110px;
        opacity: 1;
    }
    100% {
        top: 500px;
        opacity: 0;
    }
}
```

**Animated stars** 


**Animated buttons**

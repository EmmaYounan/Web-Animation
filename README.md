# 👾 Recreating artwork in the browser
During the Visual Interface Design minor we followed a web animation course. The assignment for this course was to choose an artwork and recreate that artwork for the web. Using CSS animations and much more to make a none interactive piece of artwork to an interactive one. follows. Making sure that you present the artwork in the way that it supposed to look while adding your own touch to the design. To make the most of the two worlds, I started by doing research about the artwork and what the designers intention was of the artwork. Unfortunately, there was not much to find about this particular work. that's why I mainly studied the work of the chosen designer, his style and some biography. Added to that I researched the artwork content, why it was made, and for what.

This work (poster) was made by Pierre Mendell in 1998, presenting the "The twelfth night" by Shakespeare for the Bayerische Staatsoper. Pierre Mendell is an American-German designer, and one of the world's leading graphic designers. For almost 30 years he played a role in creating the visual identity of the neue sammlung – the international design museum munich. 

Simplicity in forms is one of the many characteristics that Mendell's work had. Clean style, basic, essential, minimal, and prefers rational and smart solutions. Mendell himself says, that the reason that he prefers to avoid the use of photography is that it represents the reality that can change, while fixing a concept make it persists along time.

Another characteristic is complexity in ideas. Despite his work being connoted by immediacy and simplicity, you can find a lot of the complexity in his themes and concepts.

Mendell's work also presents very strong and immediate colors. Usually, you can find three, or almost four colors per poster. Color can be full of simulates texture or brush. 

The directness of Mendell's work can achieve the goal of transcending every cultural or idiomatic bond. 
" The key to a powerful communication begins with the use of symbols that transcend reality and can be comprised by everyone".
